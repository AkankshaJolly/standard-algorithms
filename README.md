## Standard algorithms

This is an effort to implement standard algorithms using C++ covering the following paradigms:
1. Divide and Conquer
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Greedy
4. Backtracking
5. Network Flow

Most code here are implementations of algorithms described in [Lecture Notes on Algorithm Analysis
and Computational Complexity](https://larc.unt.edu/ian/books/free/lnoa.pdf).
